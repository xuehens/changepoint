This project contains my doctorate research related R program. I tried to (1)write a literature review about changepoint(s) detection in time series data, (2)compare the statistical power of single changepoint and multiple changepoint techniques, (3)discuss their weakness when the time series data are correlted, design new approach to improve their performance.
